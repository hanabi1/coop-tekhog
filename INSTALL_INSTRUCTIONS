INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
====================


Rename two files and change two lines, then you're done!

1.  Rename config.php(ta-bort-denna-parantes) to config.php in the folder /application/config/


2.  Rename .htaccess(ta-bort-denna-parantes) in root to .htaccess with sublimeText

	Right click it in sublime and rename.
	For some reason you can't rename it in the explorer window


3.  Change the basepath in /.htaccess(row 13) to your own path
	Don't forget the '/' in the beginning AND the end

	ex. 
	RewriteBase /git/coop-tekhog/


4 . Modify the base path in /application/config/config.php(row 14) to your own project home folder
	Don't forget the / at the end

	ex:
    define('URL', 'http://localhost/samhalls_sar/');


5.  Have you created a database password? if so, SKIP this step...
	
	Input your DB password in config.php.
    It's usually blank...
    
    ex:
    //define('DB_PASS', '');

6.  Run the SQL dump /documentaion/database-export5.0.sql

There is also a very good tutorial on this MVC in the folder /_tutorial/
