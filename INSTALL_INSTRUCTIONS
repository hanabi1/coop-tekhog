INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
====================

1. Move config.php from the folder /documentation to /application/config/

2 . Modify the base path in config.php to your own project home folder
	WARNING don't forget the / at the end

	ex:
    //define('URL', 'http://localhost/samhalls_sar/');

3. Check your DB password, it's usually blank...
   ex:
   //define('DB_PASS', '');


   Congrats! It should now work!


 4. (OPTIONAL as of now) A good idea is to also apply the DB export DB-Export.sql in /documentation.
 	You don't need to create a DB first just run the magic SQL file in your DB-app of choice and PRESTO!


There is also a good tutorial on this MVC in the folder /tutorial
