INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
====================

1. Rename config.php(ta-bort-denna-parantes) to config.php in the folder /application/config/

2 . Rename /.htaccess(ta-bort-denna-parantes) to .htaccess with sublimeText

	Right click it in sublime and rename.
	For some reason you cant rename it in the explorer window


3. Change the basepath in /.htaccess(row 13) to your own path
	Don't forget the '/' in the beginning AND the end

	ex. 
	RewriteBase /git/coop-tekhog/

4 . Modify the base path in /application/config/config.php to your own project home folder
	Don't forget the / at the end

	ex:
    define('URL', 'http://localhost/samhalls_sar/');

5. Input your database name in config.php ('samhalls_sar' is recomended)

   Input your DB password in config.php.
   It's usually blank...
   
   ex:
   //define('DB_PASS', '');

6. Create a DB called 'samhalls_sar' with Sequel Pro/Heidi/phpMyAdmin etc

   No need to run a database dump!


If you encounter any problems, delete the DB samhalls_sar and create it again.

Then just run the website as normal it will create all the tables.


There is also a very good tutorial on this MVC in the folder /_tutorial/
