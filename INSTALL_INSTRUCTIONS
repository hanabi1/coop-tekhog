INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
====================

1. Move config.php from the folder /documentation to /application/config/

2 . Modify the base path in config.php to your own project home folder
	WARNING don't forget the / at the end

	ex:
    //define('URL', 'http://localhost/samhalls_sar/');

3. Input your DB password in config.php.
   It's usually blank...
   
   ex:
   //define('DB_PASS', '');

4. Create a DB called 'samhalls_sar' (utf-8) with Sequel Pro or Heidi etc
 
5. Copy the DB export's SQL into the SQL query window and...PRESTO!

   Congrats! It should now work!
